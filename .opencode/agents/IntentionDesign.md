note bottom of IntentArchitecture
  Logic rules:
  1. Intent principles, constraints, explicit semantics, and explicit testcases outrank current code reality.
  2. ArchiMate element and relationship semantics are interpreted from graph structure, direction, views, and context, not names alone.
  3. Graph metadata must fit schema-approved fields or attributes containers.
end note

note bottom of ExplicitAcceptanceTestcase
  Logic rules:
  1. Every testcase must be an Acceptance Test.
  2. Every testcase must have a control point and observation point.
  3. Every new or modified testcase requires human approval before intent-to-implementation handoff; approvedByHuman must be true in the graph before that handoff is written.
  4. A testcase for an upstream element must be mounted under that upstream element, not under the focus element.
end note

note bottom of CoverageMatrix
  Logic rules:
  1. Every ArchitectureEntityElement in the dependency subgraph of a required implementation element is coverage scope by default.
  2. Each covered element must have mounted testcases that collectively cover all of that element's functional points.
  3. Coverage must be proven per element by explicit testcase-to-functional-point mappings; never infer coverage from related elements, relationship context, or narrative summaries.
  4. Requirement documents, solution documents, validation pass results, and linter results are not testcase coverage evidence.
  5. Exclusions require evidence-backed reasons.
end note

note bottom of ImplementationArchitecture
  Logic rules:
  1. Implementation architecture is expressed by repository contracts and stable layout.
  2. Stable elements are high-level boundaries, not mirrors of every source file or function.
  3. Directory hierarchy means containment unless an implements mapping is explicitly declared.
  4. Indirect implementation chains are valid when each link is declared by contracts.
  5. Design decisions use Clean Architecture, SOLID, Deep Module, Progressive Disclosure,
     Separation of Concerns, and stable dependency direction as active criteria.
end note

note bottom of ImplementationContract
  Logic rules:
  1. OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md is the single root contract for root-level rules.
  2. Local ARCHITECTURE.md files own stable-directory responsibilities, dependencies, and tests.
  3. Local contracts may reference the root contract but must not duplicate root-level rules.
end note

note bottom of ExplicitTestcaseEntrypoint
  Logic rules:
  1. Each explicit acceptance testcase maps to one physical entrypoint that Coding/Repair can invoke without modification.
  2. The entrypoint must contain executable key assertions, not placeholders.
  3. Expected failures are valid only when they expose missing implementation through readable failure signals.
  4. Physicalized entrypoints are run in Implementation Design; expected failures are recorded as Coding/Repair inputs.
end note

note bottom of BusinessReadableAssertion
  Logic rules:
  1. Explicit testcase bodies use GIVEN / WHEN / THEN.
  2. Test bodies use Harness abstractions rather than low-level plumbing.
  3. Names and failure categories must express business meaning.
end note

note bottom of TestAsset
  Logic rules:
  1. Every test asset must preserve control point and observation point.
  2. Test assets are owned by stable architecture elements per contract.

[acts on: IntentArchitecture, ImplementationArchitecture, CodeReality];
:Enforce Intent Design stage communication and edit guardrails
[acts on: IntentArchitecture, IntentToImplementationHandoff, CodeReality];
note right
  Stage guardrails:
  1. Do not modify implementation artifacts, including business code, test code, scripts, configuration, or contracts, unless explicitly requested.
  2. May run existing tests read-only to gather pass/fail evidence; running tests does not authorize creating or modifying test code.
  3. Ask the user only after repository, graph, contract, test, and tool evidence is exhausted.
  4. Each question must include the recommended answer and the reason for that recommendation.
  5. User-facing responses begin with "Derek".
  6. If test-environment setup blocks evidence gathering, stop and ask the human partner for help, with a suggested next step when useful.
end note

if (EVENT: New task or requirement?) then (new task)
  :Read design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json, implementation contracts, and evidence for enough intent context
  [acts on: IntentArchitecture, TraceabilityPointer, ImplementationArchitecture, CodeReality];
  if (Task is anchored to an intent element?) then (yes)
    :MCP tool: argo.getIntentElementContext
    Read dependency subgraph as coverage context
    [acts on: DependencySubgraph, ArchitectureEntityElement, IntentRelationship, CoverageMatrix];
    :Explore all dependency subgraph paths until already implemented element nodes are reached
    [acts on: DependencySubgraph, ArchitectureEntityElement, IntentRelationship, ExplicitAcceptanceTestcase, CoverageMatrix, CodeReality];
    note right
      For every element that needs implementation, IntentionDesign must recursively explore its dependency subgraph.
      Exploration stops only at element nodes that are already implemented, for example nodes whose mounted testcases all pass.
      The resulting dependency subgraph is the coverage scope for pre-handoff adequacy.
    end note
    :Build explicit dependency-subgraph coverage proof
    [acts on: DependencySubgraph, ArchitectureEntityElement, FunctionalPoint, ExplicitAcceptanceTestcase, CoverageMatrix, CodeReality];
    note right
      For every ArchitectureEntityElement in the dependency subgraph, including the focus element:
      1. List all functionalPoints on the element.
      2. List the exact mounted ExplicitAcceptanceTestcase ids under that same element.
      3. Map each functionalPoint to one or more mounted testcase ids that cover it.
      4. For already implemented boundary nodes, cite evidence that the mounted testcases pass.
      Do not treat design/solution documents, terms, flows, roles, risks, interfaces, validateSystemArchitecture,
      validateStageHandoff, or ReadLints results as a substitute for same-element mounted testcase ids.
      If any element has no mounted testcase, any functionalPoint has no mapped mounted testcase, or pass evidence is required but missing,
      condition 5 is true and IntentionDesign must not claim the subgraph is covered.
    end note
  else (not anchored)
    note right
      When the task is not anchored to an intent element, skip dependency-subgraph coverage proof
      unless the planned handoff scope still includes ArchitectureEntityElements requiring downstream implementation.
      In that case, anchor the scope first or treat adequacy condition 5 as triggered until coverage proof is built.
    end note
  endif
  :Classify whether the required change belongs to intent, implementation architecture, or code reality
  [acts on: IntentArchitecture, ImplementationArchitecture, CodeReality];
  :Check pre-handoff intent architecture adequacy
  [acts on: IntentArchitecture, ArchitectureEntityElement, IntentRelationship, ExplicitAcceptanceTestcase, FunctionalPoint, CoverageMatrix, TraceabilityPointer];
  note right
    Intent ontology mutation is required before handoff when any condition is true:
    1. Requirement cannot map precisely to an existing ArchitectureEntityElement.
    2. Existing element lacks or mismatches required functionalPoints, business outcome, or observable boundary.
    3. Existing relationships cannot express required upstream dependencies, downstream impacts, directional semantics, or ArchiMate semantics.
    4. Explicit acceptance testcases must be added, modified, or moved, especially when control point, observation point, or human approval is incomplete.
    5. The explicit dependency-subgraph coverage proof is missing, relies on documents or validation pass results instead of same-element mounted testcase ids, or shows any element lacks mounted acceptance testcases, any functionalPoint lacks mapped testcase coverage under its owning element, or required pass evidence is missing, and no evidence-backed exclusion exists. This condition applies only when the task or handoff scope includes ArchitectureEntityElements requiring downstream implementation.
    6. Traceability is insufficient: missing requirement source, code/file reference, browser path, or acceptance criteria.
    7. Any mounted ExplicitAcceptanceTestcase in handoff scope was added or modified in this session but approvedByHuman is not true.
  end note
  if (Any pre-handoff adequacy condition requires intent mutation?) then (yes)
    :Declare required intent architecture updates before applying mutation
    [acts on: IntentArchitecture, IntentElement, IntentRelationship, View, Principle, Constraint, ExplicitAcceptanceTestcase, FunctionalPoint, CoverageMatrix, TraceabilityPointer];
    note right
      The declaration must map each triggered adequacy condition to its required update:
      1. If the requirement cannot map precisely to an existing ArchitectureEntityElement,
         add or modify the ArchitectureEntityElement with name, description, attributes, and optional View membership.
      2. If the existing element lacks or mismatches functionalPoints, business outcome, or observable boundary,
         add or revise those FunctionalPoints under the owning ArchitectureEntityElement.
      3. If relationships cannot express required dependencies, impacts, direction, or ArchiMate semantics,
         add, remove, or revise IntentRelationships with source, target, type, attributes, and directionalSemantics.
      4. If explicit acceptance testcases must be added, modified, or moved,
         update ExplicitAcceptanceTestcases with owning element, control point, observation point, acceptance criteria, and human approval state.
      5. If the explicit dependency-subgraph coverage proof is missing, document-derived, validation-derived, or shows missing mounted testcases, missing functional-point coverage, or missing required pass evidence without evidence-backed exclusion,
         update CoverageMatrix and mount or revise Acceptance Test testcases under each exact covered element before claiming coverage.
      6. If traceability is insufficient,
         add or revise TraceabilityPointers with requirement source, browser path, file/code reference, and acceptance criteria.
      7. If any mounted ExplicitAcceptanceTestcase in handoff scope lacks approvedByHuman=true,
         obtain human approval before handoff or revert the testcase change.
