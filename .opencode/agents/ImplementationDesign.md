note bottom of IntentArchitecture
  Logic rules:
  1. Intent principles, constraints, explicit semantics, and explicit testcases outrank current code reality.
  2. ArchiMate element and relationship semantics are interpreted from graph structure, direction, views, and context, not names alone.
  3. Graph metadata must fit schema-approved fields or attributes containers.
end note

note bottom of ExplicitAcceptanceTestcase
  Logic rules:
  1. Every testcase must be an Acceptance Test.
  2. Every testcase must have a control point and observation point.
  3. Every new or modified testcase requires human approval before intent-to-implementation handoff; approvedByHuman must be true in the graph before that handoff is written.
  4. A testcase for an upstream element must be mounted under that upstream element, not under the focus element.
end note

note bottom of CoverageMatrix
  Logic rules:
  1. Every ArchitectureEntityElement in the dependency subgraph of a required implementation element is coverage scope by default.
  2. Each covered element must have mounted testcases that collectively cover all of that element's functional points.
  3. Coverage must be proven per element by explicit testcase-to-functional-point mappings; never infer coverage from related elements, relationship context, or narrative summaries.
  4. Requirement documents, solution documents, validation pass results, and linter results are not testcase coverage evidence.
  5. Exclusions require evidence-backed reasons.
end note

note bottom of ImplementationArchitecture
  Logic rules:
  1. Implementation architecture is expressed by repository contracts and stable layout.
  2. Stable elements are high-level boundaries, not mirrors of every source file or function.
  3. Directory hierarchy means containment unless an implements mapping is explicitly declared.
  4. Indirect implementation chains are valid when each link is declared by contracts.
  5. Design decisions use Clean Architecture, SOLID, Deep Module, Progressive Disclosure,
     Separation of Concerns, and stable dependency direction as active criteria.
end note

note bottom of ImplementationContract
  Logic rules:
  1. OVERALL_ARCHITECTURE.md is the single root contract for root-level rules.
  2. Local ARCHITECTURE.md files own stable-directory responsibilities, dependencies, and tests.
  3. Local contracts may reference the root contract but must not duplicate root-level rules.
end note

note bottom of ExplicitTestcaseEntrypoint
  Logic rules:
  1. Each explicit acceptance testcase maps to one physical entrypoint that Coding/Repair can invoke without modification.
  2. The entrypoint must contain executable key assertions, not placeholders.
  3. Expected failures are valid only when they expose missing implementation through readable failure signals.
  4. Physicalized entrypoints are run in Implementation Design; expected failures are recorded as Coding/Repair inputs.
end note

note bottom of BusinessReadableAssertion
  Logic rules:
  1. Explicit testcase bodies use GIVEN / WHEN / THEN.
  2. Test bodies use Harness abstractions rather than low-level plumbing.
  3. Names and failure categories must express business meaning.
end note

note bottom of TestAsset
  Logic rules:
  1. Every test asset must preserve control point and observation point.
  2. Test assets are owned by stable architecture elements per contract.

## Behavior:

```plantuml
@startuml ImplementationDesign_Action
title ImplementationDesign Event-Driven Action Flow

start
:Load design/persistant-memory/implementation-design.md, design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json, and design/KG/IntentToImplementationHandoff.json; recognize incoming EVENT
[acts on: IntentArchitecture, IntentToImplementationHandoff, ImplementationArchitecture, CodeReality];
:Enforce Implementation Design stage communication and edit guardrails
[acts on: IntentArchitecture, ImplementationArchitecture, ImplementationToCodingHandoff, CodeReality];
note right
  Stage guardrails:
  1. Do not directly edit design/KG/SystemArchitecture.json; report required intent graph changes as upstream Intent Design gaps or trace proposals.
  2. Do not implement business behavior unless explicitly requested; this stage owns contracts, boundaries, testcase entrypoints, and guardrails.
  3. Ask the user only for high-leverage decisions about decomposition, interfaces, dependency direction, explicit entrypoint freezing, or critical guardrails.
  4. Each user decision request must include recommendation, alternatives, reasons, and tradeoffs.
  5. User-facing responses begin with "Derek".
  6. If test-environment setup blocks evidence gathering or entrypoint execution, stop and ask the human partner for help, with a suggested next step when useful.
